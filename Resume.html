		<div class="about">
			<h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
			<p>My attitude towards work is to do what I must accomplish my goal at hand while looking for ways to speed up the process. At my current position I do 95% of my work on a computer so I try to automate as much as I can. I enjoy finding solutions to problems and continually trying to improve upon those solutions. I am always looking to learn. A strong quality of mine is a willingness to approach a problem in several different ways, as opposed to beating one's head against the wall. I think that many businesses have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to increasing the efficiency of their day to day computer-based operations. I have the skills to streamline these businesses.
